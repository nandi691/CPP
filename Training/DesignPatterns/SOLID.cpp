/*
 * SOLID Principles
 *
 * -------------------------------------
 * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 * -------------------------------------
 * Everything should do only one thing
 * Change will be easy
 * Cohesion - Measure of strength of assocication of the elements inside a module
 * A class should have only one reason to change
 *
 * std::vector follows SRP
 * std::string does not follow SRP
 *
 * Prefer Cohesive Software entities, everything that does not belong together must be seperated
 *
 * ---------------------
 * Open-Closed Principle
 * ---------------------
 * software artifacts - Classes, modules, functions -> Open for extension
 * 													-> Closed for modification
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 * Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 * -----------------------------------
 * "Is-A" Relationship
 * Subtypes
 * Inheritence is about behaviour, not about data
 * Contract of base types is adhered
 * Adhered to required concept
 *
 *
 *
 * -------------------------------------
 * Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 * -------------------------------------
 * Strategy Design pattern
 * Do not do unnecessary coupling
 * Special case of SRP
 *
 *
 * ------------------------------------
 * Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
 * ------------------------------------
 * High level modules should not depend on low-level modules - Both should depend on abstractions
 * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
 *
 * prefer to depend on abstractions rather than concrete types
